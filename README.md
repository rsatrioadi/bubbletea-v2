# BubbleTea 2.0

**BubbleTea 2.0** is an interactive visualization tool designed to showcase the results of layered architecture recovery using the [Deductive SAR](https://doi.org/10.1145/3639476.3639776) technique.

This project builds upon the [original BubbleTea version](https://github.com/rsatrioadi/bubbletea), which was demonstrated at [VISSOFT '24](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ieee-vissoft).
